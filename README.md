# Spotify AutoHotkeys
 Some autohotkey (.ahk) scripts for controlling spotify playback.

These are some old scripts I sometimes use. I was lazy and had GPT3 fill out some of the below:


## Script: [tab.ahk](blob/main/tab.ahk)

- **Numpad0**: Pressing Numpad0 activates this hotkey, which simulates pressing `Alt+Tab` to switch between open windows.

- **Numpad4**: Pressing Numpad4 simulates `Ctrl+Shift+Tab`, which is used for cycling through tabs in reverse order in many applications.

- **Numpad6**: Pressing Numpad6 simulates `Ctrl+Tab`, which is used for cycling through tabs in forward order in many applications.

- **Numpad9**: Pressing Numpad9 simulates pressing `Ctrl+Shift+N`, which may open a new incognito/private window in some applications.

- **Numpad8**: Pressing Numpad8 simulates pressing `Ctrl+W`, which often closes the currently active tab.

- **Numpad7**: Pressing Numpad7 simulates pressing `Ctrl+T`, which typically opens a new tab in web browsers.

- **Numpad3**: Pressing Numpad3 runs the `tab.ahk` script again, allowing you to cycle through applications/windows with the Numpad0 hotkey.

- **Numpad5**: Pressing Numpad5 does nothing (no action is defined).

- **Numpad1**: Pressing Numpad1 simulates pressing `Win+D`, which minimizes or restores all open windows, showing the desktop.

- **Numpad2**: Pressing Numpad2 does nothing (no action is defined).

## Script: [SpotSpy.ahk](blob/main/SpotSpy.ahk)

This script enhances your Spotify music control experience.

- **\\**: Pressing the backslash key (`\`) simulates pressing the spacebar, which is used to play/pause music in Spotify.

- **]**: Pressing the right square bracket key (`]`) simulates pressing `Ctrl+Right Arrow`, which is used to skip to the next track in Spotify.

- **[**: Pressing the left square bracket key (`[`) simulates pressing `Ctrl+Left Arrow`, which is used to go back to the previous track in Spotify.

- **=**: Pressing the equals key (`=`) simulates pressing `Ctrl+Up Arrow`, which is used to increase the volume in Spotify.

- **-**: Pressing the hyphen key (`-`) simulates pressing `Ctrl+Down Arrow`, which is used to decrease the volume in Spotify.

- **PgUp**: Pressing the Page Up key (`PgUp`) toggles the visibility of the Spotify window.

- **PgDn**: Pressing the Page Down key (`PgDn`) toggles the visibility of the Spotify window, similar to PgUp.

## Script: [miniTab.ahk](blob/main/miniTab.ahk)

This script provides some convenient shortcuts for multimedia control and tab management.

- **ScrollLock**: Pressing the Scroll Lock key (`ScrollLock`) simulates the media play/pause function.

- **PrintScreen**: Pressing the Print Screen key (`PrintScreen`) simulates the media previous track function.

- **Pause**: Pressing the Pause key (`Pause`) simulates the media next track function.

- **Del**: Pressing the Delete key (`Del`) simulates pressing `Ctrl+Shift+Tab`, which is used for cycling through tabs in reverse order.

- **PgDn**: Pressing the Page Down key (`PgDn`) simulates pressing `Ctrl+Tab`, which is used for cycling through tabs in forward order.

- **End**: Pressing the End key (`End`) simulates pressing `Alt+Tab` to switch between open windows.

- **PgUp**: Pressing the Page Up key (`PgUp`) simulates pressing `Ctrl+T`, which typically opens a new tab in web browsers.
